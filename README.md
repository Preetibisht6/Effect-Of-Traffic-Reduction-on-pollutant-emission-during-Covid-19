# Effect Of Traffic Reduction on pollutant emission during Covid-19
 
Analysing the effect of traffic reduction on emission of gas pollutant. The main file with solution can be found [here](https://github.com/Preetibisht6/Effect-Of-Traffic-Reduction-on-pollutant-emission-during-Covid-19/blob/main/Src/Main_analysis.ipynb)

## Objective
The procject concern the change in pollutant emission(No2) during covid-19 becuase of reduction in Traffic. The Study area selected for this project is London city.

## Data Used
[Sentinel-5p ](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-5p)

[AURN  ](https://www.airqualityengland.co.uk/local-authority/?la_id=999)

[Traffic Data ](https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/regions/6)

## Results

* The traffic has tremendously dropped during 2020 and majorly during lockdown phase (April 2020 to May 2020). But it increased suddenly after the reponing of 1st phase of lockdown as people were rushing back to their homes.
* The mean satellite NO2 concentration is decreased in 2020 during specific lockdown months due to which the 2020 mean concentration has also been dropped.
* The Satellite data of tropospheric NO2 shows moderate correlation with the ground station data.
* The ground station data shows 23% mean decline in NO2 concentration from 2019 to 2020 and 4% mean decline from 2021.

In order to reduce the pollution, the limitation of road traffic could not suffice, but there is a need of a vision aimed at reconsider the polluting effects caused by the vehicle.
